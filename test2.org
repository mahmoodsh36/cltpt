an \(\compAC\) circuit is a /standard \(\compAC\) circuit/ iff:
1. the circuit is divided into layers, such that edges only connect vertices between subsequent layers.
2. in each layer there are only \(\textbooland\) or \(\textboolor\) gates (except the input layer).
3. in subsequent layers there are only different types of gates (e.g. an AND layer is followed by an OR layer, and vice versa).
we say the circuit is /very standard/ if the indegree of each gate in the first (non-input) layer is at most \(2\log(S)\), where \(S\) is the size of the circuit.
